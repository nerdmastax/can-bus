This is the code I used to interface with Microchip Low Speed CAN Bus devices as well as communicate to Chrysler stereos on the same network.

I believe this code could be modified or utilized for both high speed and low speed buses.

The code is C and should be compiled in Linux with the appropriate packages installed.
